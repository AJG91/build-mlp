This repository contains code that demonstrates how to create and train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on the [California housing][ca-housing-docs] dataset from scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

* This project relies on `python=3.12`. It was not tested with different versions.
  To view the entire list of required packages, see `requirements.txt`.
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Once you have `cd` into this repo, create a virtual environment (assuming you have `conda` installed) via
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
* Enter the virtual environment with `conda activate build-mlp-env`
* Install the packages in the repo root directory using `pip install -e .`
  (you only need the `-e` option if you intend to edit the source code in `build_mlp/`)


## Example

See [my website][my-website] for examples on how to use this code.
